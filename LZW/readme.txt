Lab3

project includes:
	table.h, table.c : Hash table used for dictionary
	lab3.c:	main driver, contains the LZW algorithms
	Makefile.txt: remove the extension, its just a Makefile
	

**Note: rename Makefile.txt to Makefile assign server didn't allow it so I had to append .txt**
To compile just use 
>> make

Usage:
>> ./lab3 <input file> <output file> <'c' or 'd'>

'c' means compress and 'd' means decompress
